# SharedMedia
If you'd like to start using custom fonts in World of Warcraft, you'll first need to download and install the addon named, "SharedMedia" from Curseforge/WoWUp.

# Adding Fonts
Then, go into your \_Retail\_\Interface\AddOns\SharedMedia folder and follow the instructions listed in the "INSTRUCTIONS for MyMedia.txt".

# Setting Fonts
After your custom font has been added to the proper folder, launch World of Warcraft and set your font in ElvUI (General > Media > Default Font > Apply Font to All), Plater (Search for the word Font), and OmniCD. _NOTE: Don't forget to use ElvUI's set for all, combat text, and set the ActionBars manually. (For some reason they don't work with the "set all" button at this time.)
